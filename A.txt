[Array]

An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100 integers, you can create an array for it.

Array Declaration
syntax:  ```dataType arrayName[arraySize];```

-Arrays have 0 as the first index, not 1. In this example, mark[0] is the first element.
-If the size of an array is n, to access the last element, the n-1 index is used. In this example, mark[4]
-Suppose the starting address of mark[0] is 2120d. Then, the address of the mark[1] will be 2124d. Similarly, the address of mark[2] will be 2128d and so on.
-This is because the size of a float is 4 bytes.

Multidimensional Arrays - array of arrays.
syntax:  ```dataType arrayName[arraySize][arraySize];```
	*add more block of arraySize for more dimension.
