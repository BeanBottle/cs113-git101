[Types, Operators and Expressions]


Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program. 

** Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.

Rules for naming a variable:
-A variable name can have only letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.
-The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
-There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.

Format Specifier:
-int			%d
-char			%c
-float			%f
-double			%lf
-short int		%hd
-unsigned int		%u
-long int		%li
-long long int		%lli
-unsigned long int	%lu
-unsigned long long int	%llu
-signed char		%c
-unsigned char		%c
-long double		%Lf

C I/O :
-All valid C programs must contain the main() function. 
-The code execution begins from the start of the main() function.
-The printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. 
-The function prints the string inside quotations.
-To use printf() in our program, we need to include stdio.h header file using the #include <stdio.h> statement.
-The return 0; statement inside the main() function is the "Exit status" of the program. It's optional.

Operators:
-specify what is to be done to variables.

Expression:
-combine variables and constants to produce new values.
