Git branch


Benefits of Branch:
Branches are used to separate different tasks
● Separate your work from the work of others
● When working on fixes or new features, do that in a separate branch
● Good for experiments, big reworks etc
● Generally the master branch should contain the latest stable version
● When a fix/feature is ready and tested, merge into master

Adding new branch - $ git branch newbranch (create "newbranch")
Switching branch - $ git checkout newbranch (move to "newbranch")
Pushing branch to remote repository - $  git push <remote> <branch>


Merging
● Branches can be “merged” back into the master branch
● This is how a commit can have more than one parent commit

Merging branch - $ git merge newbranch (merge "newbranch" to current branch)
*Conflict - when people make different changes to the same line of the same file,
            or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
