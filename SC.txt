[Storage Class]

There are 4 types of storage class:
-automatic
-external
-static
-register

register - The register keyword is used to declare register variables. Register variables were supposed to be faster than local variables.
	   However, modern compilers are very good at code optimization, and there is a rare chance that using register variables will make your program faster.

static - A static variable is declared by using the static keyword. 
For example: ```static int i;```

** The value of a static variable persists until the end of the program.

external - Variables that are declared outside of all functions are known as external or global variables. They are accessible from any function inside the program.

automatic - The variables declared inside a block are automatic or local variables. The local variables exist only inside the block in which it is declared.
